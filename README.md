# 2048-Game
it is a number game using Python
in this game we add two random generated "2" number all the time when the number added in our matrix a new random 2 will generate
but the only condition of the addition of the number is that our number should be same e.g 4 will add with 4
8 will add with 8 so on
or task is to make a number "2048" before the complete filling of the matrix
if our matrix is filled and our maximum number is less than "2048" we lose the game otherwise win

we create 3 files one is logic file in this file i make all the logics that required in the game
one is 2048 file that connect both constant and logics. this is the main file that we have to run for the game
constant file is used for the all the graphical operation using tkinter
